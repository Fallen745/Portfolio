          <p>I've been in a service industry profession for most of my life, so I'm very interested in software and programs that serve to make people's lives easier. My years in all the job categories I've had have made it easier for me to see various points of view and allow me to work hard for anyone. I aim to gain enough knowledge and experience with coding and information sciences to get into artificial intelligence and automation coding. I believe that will be the next step of the evolution of technology to assist in making every one of our lives easier and more fulfilling.
